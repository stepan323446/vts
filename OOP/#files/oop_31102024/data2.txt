The educational system of our College is based on the belief that successful engineering training is only possible if academic education and practical training are intertwined: students learn about the latest scientific and technical-technological developments, but possibly more importantly, their studies focus on practice, on implementing these state-of-the-art methods and the actual work processes in engineering projects.
