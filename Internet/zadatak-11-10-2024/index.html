    <h1>Javascript</h1>

    <p><b>JavaScript</b> <i>(/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/)</i>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]</p>
    
    <p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. It was developed in just 10 days and was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, before finally being named JavaScript. Although the name suggests a connection to Java, the two languages are quite different. JavaScript was designed to make web pages interactive, allowing for dynamic content and user interactions directly in the browser. It was primarily intended to run on the client-side (in the browser), but over time, its scope has greatly expanded.</p>

    <p>In the early 2000s, JavaScript gained widespread adoption with the rise of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which enabled dynamic content updates without reloading entire web pages. With the introduction of frameworks like jQuery and later, Node.js in 2009, JavaScript moved beyond the browser and became a powerful language for server-side development. Today, it is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, used for everything from web development to mobile apps, games, and even AI projects.</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://crockford.com/javascript/popular.html">
        "<mark>JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language</mark>. It was misnamed. It has inconsistent syntax. But it turns out, the thing that was so misunderstood about JavaScript is what makes it powerful. Its loose typing, its prototype-based inheritance, and its first-class functions are features that give it a level of flexibility not available in most other languages."
    </blockquote>
    <p>—Douglas Crockford, <cite>JavaScript: The Good Parts</cite></p>
    <p>This quote highlights how JavaScript's early perceived flaws eventually became its strengths, making it a highly flexible and powerful language for a wide variety of applications.</p>

    <h2>Nowdays</h2>

    <p>Today, JavaScript is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages globally. It plays a pivotal role in modern web development, powering both front-end and back-end technologies. Some key factors that highlight the current state and importance of JavaScript include:</p>

    <pre>
let div = document.createElement('div');
div.className = "alert";
div.innerHTML = "&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/strong&gt; You read important meesage!";

document.body.append(div);
setTimeout(() => div.remove(), 1000);
    </pre>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Omnipresence in Web Development:</b> JavaScript remains the <u>de facto language</u> for building interactive and dynamic websites. All major browsers support JavaScript, making it essential for client-side development. It is the backbone of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which dominate modern web development.</li>
        
        <li><b>Node.js and Server-Side Development:</b> With the rise of <u>Node.js</u>, JavaScript moved from being purely client-side to <u>full-stack development</u>. This has allowed developers to use the same language on both the front-end and back-end, simplifying the development process.</li>

        <li><b>Ecosystem and Libraries:</b> The <u>JavaScript ecosystem</u> is one of the largest, with an expansive library of tools, packages, and frameworks. Platforms like <u>npm</u> (Node Package Manager) provide access to millions of reusable JavaScript components, accelerating development.</li>

        <li><b>Versatility Beyond the Browser:</b> JavaScript is no longer confined to web browsers. It is now used for building <u>mobile apps</u> (using frameworks like React Native), <u>desktop applications</u> (with Electron), <u>game development</u>, and even <u>IoT</u> (Internet of Things) applications.</li>

        <li><b>Standardization and Modernization:</b> JavaScript continues to evolve, with regular updates through <u>ECMAScript</u> standards (such as ES6 in 2015), which introduced new features like arrow functions, modules, and promises. These updates keep the language modern, competitive, and in tune with developer needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, JavaScript today is a versatile, modern, and essential language for web, mobile, and back-end development. Its growth in tooling and adoption in various fields, alongside continuous improvements, ensure its relevance for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <h2>Using JavaScript</h2>

    <p>Here are several examples of how JavaScript is applied across various types of projects and domains:</p>

    <h3>Single-Page Applications (SPAs)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>React, Angular, and Vue.js</b>: JavaScript is commonly used to create SPAs that dynamically load content without requiring a page reload. For instance, popular web applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and Facebook are built with JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular.</li>
        <li><b>Trello</b>: A project management tool, Trello, is an example of a SPA that uses JavaScript to provide real-time updates and smooth user experiences without constant page reloads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server-Side Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Node.js and Express</b>: Node.js allows JavaScript to run on servers, which powers back-end services like APIs and handles requests. For instance, the PayPal and LinkedIn server infrastructures use Node.js for handling millions of transactions and concurrent requests.</li>

        <li><b>Netflix</b>: Netflix uses Node.js for its server-side rendering and real-time updates, allowing the platform to handle a large number of users simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cross-Platform Mobile Apps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>React Native</b>: JavaScript is used in frameworks like React Native to build mobile applications that run on both Android and iOS from a single codebase. Examples include apps like Instagram, Airbnb, and Facebook.</li>
        <li><b>Ionic Framework</b>: This allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</li>
    </ul>
